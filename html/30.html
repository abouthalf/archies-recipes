<h2>Orange custard</h2>

<ul>
<li>1 teaspoon orange peel</li>
<li>1 teaspoon grated lemon peel</li>
<li>1 cup orange juice</li>
<li>2 teaspoons lemon juice</li>
<li>2 cups milk</li>
<li>½ cup sugar</li>
<li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
<li>3 eggs, separated</li>
<li>2 tablespoons unflavored gelatine</li>
<li>Fresh fruit for garnishing</li>
</ul>

<p>Soften gelatin in milk for 5 minutes, then heat on top of double boiler until milk reaches scalding temperature. Add sugar and salt to slightly beaten egg yolks, and stir in hot milk slowly. Return to double boiler and cook, stirring constantly until it has the consistency of custard (about 5 minutes); remove custard from heat, add grated orange and lemon peel and juice. When cold and beginning to thicken (about 30 minutes), fold into egg whites, beaten until stiff, and dry. Rinse a 1 ½ qt size mold in cold water and pour orange custard into it. Chill over night. To serve, unsold and garnish with orange slices or berries if desired.</p>
