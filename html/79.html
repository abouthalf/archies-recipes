<h1>Wine Receipt</h1>

<p>To each quart of fruit add one quart of water. Put in churn or jar and mash fruit well. Let ferment about seven days, stir well each day. Strain through cloth bag and pour back in churn. Add 3 lbs. brown sugar to each gallon of juice. Let stand four or five days until it quits foaming. Then strain again and it is ready to be bottled.</p>

<p>Put in bottles and keep in a dark place. Don’t put corks in too tight, but tighten a little each day. Be sure bottles are full to top, right to bottom of cork.</p>
