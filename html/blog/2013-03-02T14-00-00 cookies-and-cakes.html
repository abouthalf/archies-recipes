<p>Pages <a href="/26.html">26</a> and <a href="/27.html">27</a> close out the cookie chapter and hold all of the candy recipes. If all of these sweets aren’t enough, don’t worry. The dessert section is up next.</p>

<p>So far there have been 3 recipes named “Divinity” - it’s interesting that sweet treats were associated with the term “divine”. These days most menus name their most decadent dessert with terms like “sinful” and “decadent”. I wonder when that changed.</p>
