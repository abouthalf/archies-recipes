<p>It&#8217;s been awhile. Let&#8217;s get meaty.</p>

<p>The <a href="/index_292.html">meat</a> section begins on <a href="/55.html">page 55</a> with a recipe for Swedish meatballs. The recipe calls for Zwieback crumbs. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zwieback">I had to look that up.</a> I have no memory of the word &#8216;Zwieback&#8217; but upon seeing a photo, I had a sudden, visceral, almost genetic knowledge of what these taste like. These crunchy, sweet, sort of fatty little fake toasts. I <em>know</em> someone fed these to me as child.</p>

<p>On <a href="/56.html">page 56</a> we learn about Mexene meatballs. <a href="http://www.mexene.com">Mexene</a> is a Texas chili spice mix that is, apparently, still in production today. This, and the <a href="/59.html#hottamalepie">Hot Tamale Pie</a> recipe make me think that there must have been some big influx of Texican/Mexican culture that swept the nation.</p>

<p>We also have a recipe for <a href="/57.html#kiby">&#8220;kiby&#8221; - or is it kibbi, or kibbeh</a> - which looks to be a sort of a wheat and beef variation on a falafel - Lebanese in origin apparently. I&#8217;d love to know how some Tennesseans got turned on to Lebanese cuisine.</p>
