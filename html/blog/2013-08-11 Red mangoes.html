<p>Everybody loves <a href="/61.html">macaroni</a>. The macaroni section of Archie’s recipes includes a classic <a href="/61.html#macaroni-cheese">macaroni and cheese</a> (complete with no-name Velveeta™), as well as macaroni loaf, and a go-to <a href="/61.html#http://recipe.local/61.html#macaroni-sauce">meat sauce for macaroni </a>. Today when we hear “macaroni” we almost always think of elbow macaroni (maybe that comes in a blue box), but the term refers to the type of flour used not to the shape of the noodle. The <a href="/62.html#http://recipe.local/62.html#macaroni-ham-escallop">macaroni and ham escallop</a> recipe calls for “18 sticks” of macaroni. I can only assume that means 18 big, fat noodles. If I were attempting this recipe, I’d use lasagna noodles.</p>

<p><a href="/63.html">Pickles begin on page 63</a> with dill, onion, and sweet varieties. An orphaned recipe for <a href="/66.html#green-sweet-tomato-pickles">sweet green tomato pickles</a> is cross referenced here, but it lives with the sauces on page 66.</p>

<p><a href="/64.html#tomato-ketchup">Tomato ketchup</a> gets its own mention in the index and shares a page with <a href="/64.html#sauerkrout">sauerkraut</a> and a recipe for <a href="/64.html#cucumbers">cucumbers</a> which looks suspiciously like another pickle recipe. The ketchup recipe calls for “red mangoes” which threw me. Mangoes? In Tennessee? <em>In ketchup?</em> How exotic. It turns out that the word “mango” <a href="http://www.word-detective.com/2009/04/mango/">became associated with anything pickled</a> (mangoes first came to the United States pickled). A pickled concoction of bell pepper and cabbage was very popular and the word “mango” became associated with peppers.</p>

<p>The <a href="/65.html">sauces section</a>, beginning on page 65, includes a <a href="/65.html#mexene-barbecue-sauce">“Mexene” barbecue sauce</a>. Mexene is the brand name of a chili powder mix you can still <a href="http://www.mexene.com/">buy today</a>. The barbecue sauce is vinegar based (the way god intended) but uses this Texan stye spice mix. I like to think of it as a great diplomatic outreach to other forms of barbecue.</p>

<p>The sauces finish off with a <a href="/65.html#hollandaise-sauce">hollandaise</a> made with “oleo” - generic slang for margarine. I guess you have to make do with what you have. (The technique is interesting, though.)</p>
