<p><a href="/10.html">Page 10</a> has been added. This page continues the cake section with recipes for Devilâ€™s Food Cake, Irish Potato Cake, and Danish Orange Cake. My favorite parts of this page are the cross references to frosting recipes, and the very minimal instructions. I think, by the time of writing this page, he had cake technique down, and only needed the ingredients list.</p>
