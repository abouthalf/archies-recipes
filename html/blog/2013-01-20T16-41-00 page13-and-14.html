<p>Pages <a href="/13.html">13</a> and <a href="/14.html">14</a> have been added to the site. Recipes include angel food cake, pound cake, apple sauce cake, fruit cake, and chocolate cake.</p>

<p>It’s interesting that some of these recipes only include ingredients, but no instructions. These recipes appear to be variations on a theme, like they are variations on other recipes — only differing in ingredients, but not technique.</p>

<p>One of the recipes comes from someone who’s surname I don’t recognize, “Alma Jeague” - I’m not sure if I’m transcribing it correctly and the name doesn’t ring a bell. Whoever she is, she puts brown sugar in her chocolate cake, which I approve of.</p>
