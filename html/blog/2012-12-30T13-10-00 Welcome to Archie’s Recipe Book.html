<p>Welcome to Archie’s Recipe book. This site is an archive of a hand-written recipe book created by my great-grandfather. </p>

<p>Each week I’ll be transcribing a new page and adding it to the site. New pages will be announced here. Any new features or updates will be announced here as well. If you use an RSS / feed reader like Google Reader or Net News Wire, you can subscribe to the <a href="/rss">RSS</a> feed.</p>
