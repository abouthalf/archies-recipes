<p>How about a nice sandwich and soup for lunch? I hope you like ham. <a href="/71.html">Soups</a>, <a href="/72.html">sandwiches</a>, and <a href="/73.html">vegetable</a> dishes have been transcribed and added.</p>

<p>I remember having this <a href="/71.html#bean-soup">bean soup</a> (or something very similar) when I was young. Thick and creamy. Very hearty. Lots of ham. It’s amusing and appropriate that a southern <a href="/71.html#vegetable-soup">vegetable soup</a> recipe begins with a big animal bone. Recipes like this <a href="/72.html#cheese-tomato">cheese and tomato</a> sandwich follow the same lead. Bacon is just assumed to be part of the sandwich. The distinguishing characteristics are the cheese and tomato. <em>Of course</em> there’s bacon.</p>

<p>Many of these recipes take a more casual, conversational tone. Fewer lists of ingredients, more general notes on techniques. I wonder if these recipes, appearing later in the book, hint that Archie had grown more confident in the kitchen and needed to write less down.</p>
