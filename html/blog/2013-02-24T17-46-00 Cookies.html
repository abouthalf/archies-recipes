<p>Pages <a href="/23.html">23</a> − <a href="/25.html">25</a> have been added. Don’t be fooled, page <a href="/24.html">24</a> was intentionally left blank.</p>

<p><a href="/23.html">Page 23</a> finishes up the cake section with clipping from an old magazine (courtesy of the California Raisin Advisory Board) and another recipe for pound cake. Neither of these seem to have made it into the index. I’ve decided not to try to force any sort of organization onto the original book, since my purpose here is archiving. The search tool provides quick access to the content. When the entire thing is transcribed perhaps I can add a more complete index.</p>

<p><a href="/25.html">Page 25</a> begins the cookie section of the book. So far all of these recipes simply list ingredients. I suppose the cookie method must have been well known.</p>
