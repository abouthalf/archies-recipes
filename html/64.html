<h1 id="tomato-ketchup">Tomato ketchup</h1>

<ul>
<li>4 oz. whole allspice</li>
<li>1 cup sugar</li>
<li>4 cups vinegar</li>
<li>3 teaspoons whole black pepper</li>
<li>1 tablespoon chopped red mangoes</li>
<li>1 oz whole cloves</li>
<li>1 gal. strained ripe tomatoes</li>
</ul>

<p>Put all spices in a small cheesecloth bag. Cook all together until it darkens in color; then take out spices. When darkened and thick, pour while hot into sterilized bottles and seal.</p>

<p>(Note) about ½ lb. tomatoes and 4 large onions cooked until soft and then drained through a colander will make 1 gal. tomato pulp</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Editor’s Note:</strong> “Red mangoes” here refers to red bell peppers</p>

<ul>

<h1 id="cucumbers">Cucumbers</h1>

<p>Wash and soak them overnight in brine not too strong. Then trim the green ends off and put in a kettle with vinegar and sugar to about cover them. Use 1 cup vinegar, 1 cup sugar, 1 cup water for the mixture if the vinegar is good and strong. Let them come to a boil, then carefully turn them over or push the top ones down in the vinegar and just let them boil a view minutes, or they will be too soft. Put a few spices in them if you like them flavored. I usually put a few more in top of can after they are done and ready to seal.</p>
