<p>Pages <a href="/29.html">29</a> and <a href="/30.html">30</a> have been added and begin the dessert section. I’m amused that desserts are a separate section from cakes, cookies, ice cream, pies, puddings, and frostings. Cakes and cookies are an every day part of life, but <a href="/30.html">orange custard</a>? <em>That’s dessert</em>.</p>

<p>The picture of page 29 has a glitch in it which obliterates some of the text. I dug back into my storage archives and found that my original scan from way back in 1999 has the same glitch. Funny that I didn’t catch that at the time or immediately thereafter, only to find it 14 years later.</p>
