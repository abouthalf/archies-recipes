<h2>Strawberry jam</h2>

<ul>
<li>4 qt strawberries</li>
<li>3 lbs sugar</li>
<li>2 or 3 tablespoons lemon juice</li>
</ul>

<p>Wash the berries, drain, and pick out the largest. Take about 1 qt of the smaller fruit, crush it, and add the sugar. Cook this rapidly in an enameled sauce pan and stir until the sugar is dissolved and a thick syrup is formed. Add the remaining of the fruit and continue the rapid cooking, stirring frequently to prevent scorching. An asbestos mat should be placed under the pan as a precaution. Cook 30 minutes or un tip fairly thick, then add the lemon juice. Pour into hot, sterilized jars, and seal and store in cool place.</p>
