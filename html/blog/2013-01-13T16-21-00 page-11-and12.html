<p>Pages <a href="/11.html">11</a> and <a href="/12.html">12</a> have been added. These pages continue the cake section with recipes for layer cake, cocoa cream cake, a ‘dixie spice’ cake, and a pecan cake (soaked in brandy).</p>

<p>So many cake recipes! I am reminded how important dessert is down South.</p>
