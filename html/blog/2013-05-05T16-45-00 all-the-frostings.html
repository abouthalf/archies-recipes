<p>All the <a href="/43.html">frostings</a>!</p>

<p>Many of the frosting recipes are just a list of ingredients with no instructions. I guess frosting technique is just knowledge you were supposed to have if you had any business in a kitchen at all.</p>

<p>I have tried to cross reference (link) <a href="/09.html">cake recipes</a> to their frosting recipes where indicated.</p>

<p>At least one of the ingredients will be hard to find. I don’t think you could find a <a href="http://recipe.local/45.html#frosting9">10¢ can of pineapple</a>, even on eBay.</p>
