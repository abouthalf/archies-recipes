<p>Apologies for the late update. I was traveling this weekend <a href="http://abouthalf.com/things/rockaway-beach-oregon/">far away</a> from the internet.</p>

<p>This week’s pages <a href="/21.html">21</a> and <a href="/22.html">22</a> include a number of cake recipes (yes more cake) a few of which seem to have been written by someone else. The handwriting and ink are totally different. Some of the recipes are credited, which isn’t unusual. Archie credited recipes from others. </p>

<p>It’s interesting though to see a completely different hand and format. I prefer the orderly, list based method Archie used over the more linear style of the others. One of the recipes is split awkwardly across two pages in the book. None of these recipes made it into the index — which leads me to believe they were added much later and crammed in on some blank pages where they would fit.</p>

<p>These recipes disrupt the lovely order of the book. I want to cheat and reorganize them better, put the recipe for Velvet orange chocolate cake all on one page, etc. But that’s not keeping with the spirit of archiving and transcribing. The book is the way it is, and I’m trying to preserve it, not improve it.</p>

<hr />

<p>On a brief formatting note - I’m going to try using actual fraction characters in the text instead of dumb ascii shorthand. That is, instead of something like 1/2, you should see ½ (on these most recent additions). Modern browsers should display these fine. If I hear no complaints, I’ll update the rest of the site.</p>
