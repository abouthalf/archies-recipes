<p>Pages 15 and 16 have been added to the site. An epic fruit cake recipe begins on page 15 and continues onto page 16 followed by a Queen of Hearts cake (which seems positively dainty compared to the fruit cake).</p>

<p>I’ve added the second index page (there are 8 total) as page 16 is linked there. It’s a sneak preview of recipes to come.</p>
