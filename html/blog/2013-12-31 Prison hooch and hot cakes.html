<p>We finish out the year with the final three pages of recipes: Waffles, hot cakes, and hooch. This “<a href="/79.html">wine</a>” recipe calls for a giant pile of sugar and seems perfect for the prohibition era basement distillery.</p>

<p>The waffles and hot cake recipes both call for incorporating beaten egg whites (a meringue) into the batter. This is a great idea that I look forward to trying. I bet it makes for super fluffy pancakes. It also occurred to me, while transcribing these recipes, that once upon a time a waffle iron was just a big heavy pan that you baked waffles in (not some ridiculous contraption found next to a hotel’s continental breakfast).</p>

<p>What’s next for Archie’s Recipes? There’s a page or two of hand written measures I’d like to include and a bit of clean up to do. Finally I’d like to format this entire site as an ebook for easy sharing and archiving.</p>
